# *Taylorism* in *DevOps*
**Frederick Taylor**, also known as the *father of scientific management*, developed a set of principles for maximizing efficiency in the manufacturing industry during the early 20th century. These principles, collectively known as **Taylorism**, were intended to standardize and streamline work processes to *increase productivity* and *reduce waste*. Today, some of these principles are still used in various industries, including *DevOps*.

# Principles of *Taylorism*
The principles of *Taylorism* are as follows:

- **Job specialization**: Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, simpler ones, and assigning them to workers based on their skills and abilities.

- **Standardization**: Developing a set of best practices and standard procedures to optimize work processes.

- **Time and motion studies**: Analyzing work processes to identify inefficiencies and developing new methods to increase productivity.

- **Incentives and rewards**: Providing incentives and rewards to motivate workers and encourage productivity.

- **Scientific training**: Providing workers with scientific training to ensure that they understand the most efficient ways to perform their tasks.

# Application of *Taylorism* in *DevOps*
*DevOps* is focused on continuous delivery and collaboration between teams to deliver high-quality software products quickly and efficiently. The principles of *Taylorism* can be applied to *DevOps* to improve efficiency and reduce waste. For example:

- **Job specialization**: In *DevOps*, team members specialize in specific tasks, such as coding, testing, and deployment. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller ones, team members can focus on their areas of expertise, resulting in higher-quality work.

- **Standardization**: *DevOps* relies on standard procedures and best practices to optimize work processes. This includes using tools such as automation and configuration management to standardize workflows and reduce the risk of errors.

- **Time and motion studies**: *DevOps* teams analyze work processes to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and then develop new methods to increase productivity. This includes identifying and automating repetitive tasks and optimizing workflows to reduce cycle times.

- **Incentives and rewards**: *DevOps* teams can be motivated by incentives such as bonuses, promotions, and recognition for their work. This helps to encourage productivity and create a culture of continuous improvement.

- **Scientific training**: *DevOps* team members are trained in the most efficient ways to perform their tasks, such as using specific tools and techniques. This helps to ensure that team members are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to optimize their work processes.

# Conclusion
While *Taylorism* was developed for the manufacturing industry, some of its principles can be applied to *DevOps* to improve efficiency and reduce waste. By breaking down complex tasks, standardizing workflows, analyzing work processes, incentivizing team members, and providing scientific training, *DevOps* teams can deliver high-quality software products quickly and efficiently. However, it is important to note that these principles must be applied in a way that is appropriate for the unique needs of each *DevOps* team and project.
