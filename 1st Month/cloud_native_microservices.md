# What are Cloud Native *Microservices*?
**Microservices* architecture is an approach to building complex applications by breaking them down into smaller, independent services. Cloud-native, on the other hand, is an approach to building and running applications that leverage the capabilities of cloud platforms. When these two approaches are combined, we get cloud-native *Microservices*.

# What are *Microservices*?
*Microservices* are small, independent services that work together to form a larger application. Each microservice performs a specific function and communicates with other *Microservices* through APIs. *Microservices* architecture is highly scalable, resilient, and allows for rapid development and deployment.

# What is Cloud Native?
Cloud-native is an approach to building and running applications that take advantage of the cloud's capabilities. Cloud-native applications are designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant. They are also highly automated, which means that developers can rapidly develop and deploy new features and updates.

# What are Cloud Native *Microservices*?
Cloud-native *Microservices* combine the principles of *Microservices* architecture and cloud-native development. They are small, independent services that are designed to run on cloud platforms. Each microservice is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant. They communicate with other *Microservices* through APIs and use containerization and orchestration technologies to automate deployment and management.

Cloud-native *Microservices* are highly modular, which means that they can be easily replaced or updated without affecting other parts of the application. They are also highly distributed, which means that they can be easily scaled up or down based on demand.

# Benefits of Cloud Native *Microservices*
Here are some of the benefits of using cloud-native *Microservices*:

- **Scalability**: Cloud-native *Microservices* architecture allows for highly scalable applications that can quickly adapt to changing demand.

- **Resilience**: Cloud-native *Microservices* are designed to be highly resilient, which means that they can continue to function even in the face of failures or downtime.

- **Agility**: Cloud-native *Microservices* architecture allows for rapid development and deployment of new features and updates, enabling organizations to quickly respond to changing market conditions.

- **Cost-Effective**: Cloud-native *Microservices* architecture allows organizations to pay only for the resources they need, making it a cost-effective approach to building and running applications.

# Conclusion
Cloud-native *Microservices* architecture is an effective approach to building and running highly scalable, resilient, and cost-effective applications. By breaking down applications into smaller, independent services and leveraging the capabilities of cloud platforms, organizations can rapidly develop and deploy new features and updates while maintaining the highest levels of scalability and resilience.
